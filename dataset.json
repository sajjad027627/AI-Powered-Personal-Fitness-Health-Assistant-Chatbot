Both swing variations work many of the same muscles, such as the hamstrings, glutes, and core, but because the weight must travel farther in the overhead swing, it's slightly more metabolically demanding and works the upper back and shoulders more. This combo can be performed for time or reps and works especially well in circuit-style or full-body training.

Proper form is essential to really feel the burn in the glutes, and the ball can help guide you into the right form better than a bench, which is the usual support for hip thrusts. Unlike the bench version, the ball hip thrust is best performed with body weight or bands as resistance for safety reasons. It can be an excellent component of a warm-up for lower-body training, or a glute activation drill performed anytime."

Instructions: The close-stance dumbbell front squat is a popular exercise for targeting the muscles of the lower body, the quadriceps in particular. Holding dumbbells in the racked position also works the core and upper-back muscles to maintain posture while the lower body moves. Because the amount of weight you can use will be limited by what you can clean to the rack position, this movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps, at least 8-12 reps per set or more. If this movement hurts your knees, try performing it with a wider stance."
